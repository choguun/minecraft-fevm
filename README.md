# minecraft-fevm

### Vision

* On-chain Minecraft-like game in which users own their assets.

### Key Features:

* Mint Land(ERC721) to access your land and create a token bound account(ERC6551) to store assets in land nft.
* Save and Load game data on-chain and decentralize with FEVM and IPFS(lighthouse.storage).
* Gamification features eg. daily check-in and in-game token reward from quests.
* Token Bound Account for Land NFT(inventory) to store in-game items(ERC1155) for accrue value of Land.
