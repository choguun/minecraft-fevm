# minecraft-fevm

### Vision

* On-chain Minecraft-like game in which users own their assets.

### Description

* We are building a decentralized and on-chain Minecraft-like game in which users own and monetize their assets on-chain by leveraging blockchain and IPFS technology.

### How to deploy minecraft-contract

* npx hradhat deploy

### How to run minecraft-web

* npm i && npm run dev

### Key Features:

1. Mint Land(ERC721) to access your land and create a token bound account(ERC6551) to store assets in land nft.
2. Save and Load game data on-chain and decentralize with FEVM and IPFS(lighthouse.storage).
3. Gamification features eg. daily check-in and in-game token reward from quests.
4. Token Bound Account for Land NFT(inventory) to store in-game items(ERC1155) for accrue value of Land.

### Technologies Used:

* Smart Contract on FEVM
* IPFS Storage by lighthouse.storage
* Game on Web by WebGL
